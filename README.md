* Burger app is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to   be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `devour It!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to      the right side of the page.
* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
* This app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. 
* It follows the MVC design pattern and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to       generate the HTML.
